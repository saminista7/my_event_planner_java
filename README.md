# MyEventPlanner (Java)

A Java-based event planning application developed as part of an undergraduate Software Development course at AUST.

---

## Overview
MyEventPlanner is a console-based Java application designed to simulate basic event planning workflows.  
The project focuses on applying core **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts and structured program design rather than advanced frameworks.

---

## Key Features
- Event creation and basic management
- Menu-driven console interaction
- Input validation and control flow
- Modular class-based design

---

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Java class design and encapsulation
- Conditional logic and loops
- Separation of concerns in a small codebase

---

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Standard Java libraries
- Console-based user interface

## How to Run
1. Compile the source files using a Java compiler:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
Run the main class:

java Main


(Exact commands may vary depending on project structure.)

## Academic Context

This project was developed as part of an undergraduate coursework requirement at
Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST) to demonstrate practical understanding of Java and software development fundamentals.

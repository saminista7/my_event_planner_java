# My Event Planner (Java)

My Event Planner is a Java-based event management application developed to automate manual event planning and record-keeping processes through a structured software system.

This project was developed as part of an undergraduate coursework requirement and focuses on applying object-oriented programming concepts and basic system design principles.

---

## Overview
The application is designed to manage event-related information in a computerized environment, allowing users to store, retrieve, and update records efficiently. By replacing manual processes with a software-driven approach, the system aims to improve accuracy, reduce redundancy, and simplify event management workflows.

---

## Key Objectives
- Automate traditional manual event planning processes
- Provide structured storage and retrieval of event data
- Reduce redundant data entry and record-keeping overhead
- Improve efficiency and reliability of basic event management tasks

---

## Features
- Event creation and basic management
- Centralized record storage
- Structured workflow for handling event-related information
- Console-based or application-driven interaction (based on implementation)

---

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** Java
- **Development Environment:** Java-compatible IDE
- **Programming Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

---

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Java class design and encapsulation
- Control flow and data handling
- Modular code structure
- Separation of responsibilities within the application

---

## Academic Context
This project was developed as part of an undergraduate **Software Development / Object-Oriented Programming** course to demonstrate foundational Java programming and system design skills.
